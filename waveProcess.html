              <h1>Wave Process</h1>
              
              <h2>WAVES</h2>
              <p>What are waves? Waves are simply layed down curls.</p> 
              
              <h2>HOW TO GET WAVES?</h2>
              <p>The first process in getting waves is getting a low cut or scalping to allow new growth in.If you go by low cut then you can pick up your brush same day or 
                 leave for like 3 days to be able to study your natural growth pattern while if you scalp,you might have to wait a week or two depending on 
                 the speed of your hair growth and in the waiting process,take time to study your hair growth direction. Waves are formed by brushing your hair in the desired pattern 
                 you want to bring out the natural curls already present in your hair.
                 To have organised waves,you have to make sure you are brushing consistently and precisely.In waving their is nothing like over brushing,
                 the more you brush,the faster your progress and the better your waves will develop over time.One thing to have in your mind
                 at the beginning of your wave journey is that wave formation is a gradual process,it doesnt happen over night,it requires dedication.Also
                 keep in mind that it gets ugly before it later gets beautiful.Consistent brushing in the right direction is the key.</p> 

              
              <h2>WAVE PATTERNS</h2>
              <p>The most common known patterns in waving presently are 360,540 and 720 waves.What makes this patterns form 
                 is the direction and angles in which you brush your hair.A link to the brushing vid of each pattern will be provided 
                 in the WAVE HELPERS page.</p> 
              
              <h2>TRAINING YOUR PATTERN</h2>
              <p>In the process of training your waves,you need to save your daily progress by wearing a durag.A durag is meant to lay down, 
                 compress and keep wave pattern in place.Failure to put on a durag before sleeping at night may be damaging to your wave pattern if not well trained,
                 as moving unconciously while sleeping may mess up your waves.</p> 
              
              <h2>WAVE CONNECTION(Combing)</h2>
              <p> Connecting your waves is the next step after getting the curls all over your scalp.Waves Connection also takes time in most cases but can be minimized by brushing precisely from the 
                  beginning of your wave journey.A Comb is a great tool to be utilized when connecting your waves as it gradually lines up your waves overtime.It is advisable to
                  comb for at least 5 minutes before each brushing session in the process of connecting your waves or making them better.</p> 
              
              <h2>ENHANCING YOUR WAVES(Products)</h2>
              <p> Products also play important roles in maintaining waves.Waving products are simply products that enhance your waves and make them look nice in 
                  the process of maintaining them.Our hair can dry out just like our skin does therefore Providing the necessary moisture is essential to keeping 
                  our hair from drying out.Water is a special medium,drinking it provides the needed water to sustain the body’s metabolic processes which in turns gives
                  our hair the needed moisture.Products are the alternative way to keeping hair moisturized.Water based products gives more advantage to moisturizing our 
                  hair in the sense that they add more shine to the hair.A good waving product will be a one that moisturize and adds shine to the hair at same time,which will 
                  vary among wavers depending on the hair texture,which means you have to find which product works best for your texture.</p> 
              
              <h2>OPTIMIZING YOUR WAVES (Wolfing)</h2>
              <p>  What is wolfing? Wolfing is the process of growing out your hair longer either to form deeper waves or to grow your hair out to
                   a curling length to better your waves formation.The numbers of week a waver can wolf varies depending on the texture and how trained the hair is.
                   Wolfing can be a source of improvements to your waves as well as drawbacks,improvements in the sense that a well maintained wolf within 
                   your wolfing limit can improve your waves look and overall formation while drawbacks in the sense that wolfing pass your wolfing limit can 
                   make you lose progress and sometimes create forks.Also when wolfing you have to make sure you are getting shape up so as to look presentable,because you are wolfing is not an excuse to look rough in appearance.</p> 
              
              <h2>LOCATING YOUR CROWN</h2>
              <p>  What is a crown?A crown is the origin of your wave pattern usually in the center of your head or slightly to the right or left where the hair goes in different directions. Locating you crown is very important to
                   getting nice and good looking waves in the sense that a well defined crown brings out the beauty of your wave pattern.The best way to get a nice crown is to
                   go with your natural crown pattern which can be located by studying the way your hair naturally grows after a low cut.Brushing your hair the way it naturally
                   grows makes your progress faster.</p> 
              
              <h2>MINIMIZING AND WAVING UP YOUR CROWN</h2>
              <p> Goal of a crown in waving is minimizing it as much as you can to make your pattern complete.Most wavers like their crown
                  a little bit opened while others like it closed,but what matters most is making sure your waves are waved up to the crown area.
                  To accomplish this,a seperate crown sessiong should be incorporated in your brushing sessions where you only brush your crown area alone with a soft/medium brush.
                  In the process of waving up your crown again you have to go through the process called crown wolfing.Wolfing your crown means allowing it to grow
                  out so that their will be enough hair needed to wave up the crown area.</p> 
              
              <h2>MINIMIZING OR AVOIDING FORKS</h2>
              <p> What are forks?A fork is a junction where two wave lines are connected to one,making it look like a fork shape.Forks can be minimized or avoided by brushing precisely,
                  by combing and by wolfing.I will classify forks as been formed by two reasons.FIRST reason is unprecise brushing,the solution to this is making sure 
                  you brush precisely in every brush session,having a hand mirror while standing in front of a wall mirror will make it easier to precisely brush all 
                  areas of your hair.SECOND reason is having unequal length of curls in some areas which causes breakage in connection,a possible and solution to this is wolfing 
                  to grow out your hair and hard brushing to line them up.Forks can be frustrating to wavers at times but what matters most is getting your pattern right first,when you
                  have a fully developed patterns forks may not be fully noticed.Skinny/micro wavers have more tendencies of getting more forks when compared to medium/large wavers.</p> 

              <h2>CONTROLLING FRIZZ</h2>
              <p> What is frizz? Frizz is the messy tangle of hair that sits upon your head from time to time or hair into knots or tight curls.
                  Before you can reduce frizz,you need to understand why your hair is frizzy in the first place, because you may be causing your own hair to frizz.
                  Frizz can be classified into two.First is based on weather and the SECOND is based on the products you use and how you apply them.Also from my experience
                  untrained hair tends to be more frizzy in the process of getting waves,but as your waves line up over time you will forget whats called frizz.
                  Frizzy hair can be caused when the moisture and natural oils in hair is removed which leaves hair strands coarse and dry making it easier for hair to look frizzy.
                  Frizzy hair can also be caused based on the products applied on hair and the amount used,when applying products to your hair.When applying products to your hair
                  do not apply too much,apply little by little and if you feel your hair needs more apply it as needed.
                  Most wavers also experience frizz in the process of wolfing in combination with the weather 
                  condition,this can be solved by doing an hot oil treatmemt once a week and combing before each brushing session ATG and WTG or thrice a week WTG if your
                  pattern is not fully trained.</p> 

              <h2>SHOWER BRUSHING</h2>
              <p>Shower brushing as the name implies is self defined,which means brushing in the shower.This method helps in speeding up the process of getting and improving 
                 waves.This is because you have more control of your hair when you are in the shower or when your hair is wet,giving you total control to manipulate
                 your hair in the direction you want. </p> 

              <h2>WAVES CUT.</h2>
              <p>In waving two type of hair cut are known among wavers which are With the grain cut(WTG) and Against the grain cut(ATG).
                 This two types of cut have both their purposes in the process of getting waves.For beginners,it is a must you get your cut
                 always with the grain(WTG) until your pattern is fully established.The reason behind this is because going against the grain for
                 beginners will cut your progress off since your waves are not deeply trained yet.Therefore 
                 it advisable for beginners to get WTG cut.A number 2 guard is a safe guard to stick with when getting a cut WTG to avoid loosing progress.
                 When getting a cut with the grain you alway want to make sure your barber is cutting your hair in same direction you brush.
                 which means you will be the one to instruct your barber how you want the cut and which guard you want.
                 For Wavers that have fully established their pattern,against the grain cut(ATG) is much more better than WTG  in the sense that
                 ATG cut gives you an even cut all around as opposed to WTG cut and  also makes your crown progress intact because since you are going ATG
                 you dont have to worry about cutting your crown off.In conclusion to WAVES CUT,in waving what works for a waver might not work for another because
                 we all got different textures,which means you have to stick with what works for you. You will be the one to decide which cut works best for you after trying out both types of cuts.
                 Keep in mind that when cutting ATG you must use the appropriate guard, the rule is double the gaurd size.</p> 
                 <ul>
                    <li>1WTG=2ATG</li>
                    <li>1.5WTG=3ATG</li>
                    <li>2WTG=4ATG</li>
                    <li>2.5WTG=5ATG</li>
                    <li>3WTG=6ATG</li>
                    <li>3.5WTG=7ATG</li>
                    <li>4WTG=8ATG</li>
                 </ul>
                 

              <h2>SELF BARBER.</h2>
              <p>Been your own barber is very crucial and an advantage to maintaining your waves and keeping your own progress.
                 The reason why it is advisable to be your own barber is because only you can cut your waves to your own taste,
                 most barbers dont know how much work you have put in to get to your current progress and any small mistake during 
                 the cutting process might be vital to the progress you have made so far. With that been said if you cant find a good
                 barber to cut your waves(when i mean a good barber,i mean a barber who knows about cutting waves and would follow your instuctions)
                 then the best option is learning how to cut your own waves.Links to informative videos on how to cut your waves  will be
                included on the WAVE HELPER page.</p> 

              <h2>WASHING YOUR WAVES.</h2>
              <p>Keeping your hair clean is crucial to the overall health and appearance of your waves.Depending on your preference you have to fix a wash routine as a waver 
                 whether you feel your hair is dirty or not.Wavers should wash their hair at least once a week,clean waves implies healthy waves,you dont want to leave those products 
                 in your hair for a long time before washing them out especially if you are the type of waver that use 2 to 3 different products daily.If your wash routine is once a 
                 week then you have to avoid product build up as much as you can.Your wash day should also be an advantage to getting your pattern right as your hair is wet and
                 can be easily manipulated to see your pattern more clearly and make corrections as needed.</p> 

              <h2>CONDITIONING/HOT OIL TREATMENT</h2>
              <p>Conditioning/Hot oil treatment is an advisable practice in waving especially when wolfing.This helps makes your hair strands
                 more soft and manageable while giving it a shining look.Conditioning also known as co-washing helps in maintaining the health 
                 of your waves by reparing damage hair and providing needed nourishment for you hair as needed.Once a week for either of the two or both is a proper time selection.</p> 
              
              <h2>CROWN GUIDE</h2>
              <p>Alot of wavers have a problem with their crown and don't quite know how to tackle it. Well most likely its
                 cause you are not brushing it correctly or not even brushing it at all. We all have a small swirl on the top of our head,
                 either its on the left/right/middle and anywhere in between going clockwise or counter clockwise. This also is the reason
                 for "weak-sides" because you don't know which way your hair naturally grows and your not brushing it enough.This is strictly
                 a crown guide,the first thing I recommend is that you cut your hair low, this is the most effective way to see where EXACTLY
                 your crown is and how it grows. This is also good so you can get a good foundation on your overall pattern starting from your
                 crown therefore you whole head will wave up better and more connected. Now if your one of those who refuse to cut it low there
                 is an option for you too, tedious but can be done. Get in front of a mirror mirror and comb your hair ATG, yes ATG! Now look up
                 close at how the hair bends closest to the scalp with the end of a rat-tail comb or bobby pin and lay it that way. Keep in mind
                 it will form a swirl so look for that. Once you find how your hair grows naturally take a pomade of choice ( for me its Curls passion fruit control paste sculpting shine pomade)
                 and your index finger and lay it on and around your crown. Rub it till it lays down and hairs that don't lay right use that rat-tail again to put them in place.
                 Once you get the hair layed how you want it, brush it this way. You can brush all the way to your hairline but its recommended to  brush out only an inch or 2 and keep it isolated.
                 Only once it waves up then go out to the hairline. Now you can implement any wave pattern you your natural crown growth 360/540/720.
                 If yours goes clockwise brush it clockwise. If counterclockwise brush it counterclockwise.<span class="important">...#comptonjosh92</span> </p>
