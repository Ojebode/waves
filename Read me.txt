This was one of the website i designed for fun in 2014 which contains information about a popular hairstyle called waves as i belong to the global community of the wavers in which most of the memebers of this community are Americans.

I used Microsoft Expression Web for this project and i bought a domain for 2 years which the website was up and running on til my domain subscription expired.

Main components of the site includes:
HTML pages
Cascading Style Sheets(CSS)
Images used for graphics
Javascript to iterate the banner image design.

P.S: If you like the waves hairstyle and will love to learn more about it, join the wave page below on facebook.
